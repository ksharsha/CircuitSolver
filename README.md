# CircuitSolver
In this project we developed implemented an algorithm in matlab to identify the different components present in a circuit and solve for the voltage and current at every node in the circuit.
This involves several challenging tasks such as identifying the resistors, segmenting them, identifying different nodes in the circuit, connecting all the identifies components to their nodes, coming up with an impedance matrix and finally solving for the voltages.

Run the aacircuit_solver.m file and make sure that the circuit on which you want to run is named as 'download.jpg' and is in the same folder, if not load the image accordingly.
